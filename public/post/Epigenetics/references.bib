	abstract = {In the epigenetics field, large-scale functional genomics datasets of ever-increasing size and complexity have been produced using experimental techniques based on high-throughput sequencing. In particular, the study of the 3D organization of chromatin has raised increasing interest, thanks to the development of advanced experimental techniques. In this context, Hi-C has been widely adopted as a high-throughput method to measure pairwise contacts between virtually any pair of genomic loci, thus yielding unprecedented challenges for analyzing and handling the resulting complex datasets. In this review, we focus on the increasing complexity of available Hi-C datasets, which parallels the adoption of novel protocol variants. We also review the complexity of the multiple data analysis steps required to preprocess Hi-C sequencing reads and extract biologically meaningful information. Finally, we discuss solutions for handling and visualizing such large genomics datasets.},

	abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D)-chromatin organization is critical for proper enhancer-promoter communication and, therefore, for a precise execution of the transcriptional programs governing cellular processes. The emergence of Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methods, in particular Hi-C, has allowed the investigation of chromatin interactions on a genome-wide scale, revealing the existence of overlapping molecular mechanisms that we are just starting to decipher. Therefore, disentangling Hi-C signal into these individual components is essential to provide meaningful biological data interpretation. Here, we discuss emerging views on the molecular forces shaping the genome in 3D, with a focus on their respective contributions and interdependence. We discuss Hi-C data at both population and single-cell levels, thus providing criteria to interpret genomic function in the 3D-nuclear space.},
