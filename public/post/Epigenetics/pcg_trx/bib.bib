Intricate layers of regulation determine the unique gene expression profiles of a given cell and, therefore, underlie the immense phenotypic diversity observed among cell types. Understanding the mechanisms that govern which genes are expressed and which genes are silenced is a fundamental focus in biology. The Polycomb and Trithorax group chromatin proteins play important roles promoting the stable and heritable repression and activation of gene expression, respectively. These proteins, which are conserved across metazoans, modulate post-translational modifications on histone tails and regulate nucleosomal structures. Here, we review recent advances that have shed light on the mechanisms by which these two classes of proteins act to maintain epigenetic memory and allow dynamic switches in gene expression during development.},

	abstract = {Embryonic development requires the intricate balance between the expansion and specialisation of defined cell types in time and space. The gene expression programmes that underpin this balance are regulated, in part, by modulating the chemical and structural state of chromatin. Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), a family of essential developmental regulators, operate at this level to stabilise or perpetuate a repressed but transcriptionally poised chromatin configuration. This dynamic state is required to control the timely initiation of productive gene transcription during embryonic development. The two major PRCs cooperate to target the genome, but it is PRC1 that appears to be the primary effector that controls gene expression. In this review I will discuss recent findings relating to how PRC1 alters chromatin accessibility, folding and global 3D nuclear organisation to control gene transcription.},
