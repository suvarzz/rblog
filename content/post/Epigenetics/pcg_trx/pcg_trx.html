<h2>Polycomb group PcG proteins</h2>
<p><strong>Polycomb group</strong> (PcG) proteins generally maintain gene repression, whereas <strong>Trithorax group</strong> (TrxG) proteins maintain the active gene expression.</p>
<p>PcG and TrxG proteins were initially isolated in <em>Drosophila</em> as factors involved in maintaining the expression patterns of HOX genes, which encode transcription factors that are important determinants of patterning during embryonic development.</p>
<p>In mammals, PRCs are targeted to a subset of CpG islands (CGIs) at the promoters of developmental genes and prevent unscheduled cellular differentiation.</p>
</div>
<div id="prc1" class="section level2">
<h2>PRC1</h2>
<p>PcG proteins form Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC1 ubiquitinylates histone H2AK119 (H2AK118 in Drosophila) and alter chromatin structure whereas PRC2 trimethylates histone H3K27.</p>
<p>PRC1 is composed of the core components <strong>Polycomb</strong> (Pc), <strong>Polyhomeotic</strong> (Ph), <strong>Posterior sex combs</strong> (Psc) and <strong>Sex combs extra</strong>.</p>
<p>Pc can bind the H3K27me3 that facilitate anchoring the complex to chromatin.</p>
<p>Psc and Sce form a heterodimer, which enhances the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of the complex. This activity is provided by the Sce subunit of</p>
<p>PRC1, which monoubiquitylates H2AK118 (K119 in mammals). This ubiquitylation event is thought to restrict RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation, but was also shown to recruit PRC2 members.</p>
<p>Ph subunit is able to bind itself that promotes spreading of PRC1 complex.</p>
</div>
<div id="prc2" class="section level2">
<h2>PRC2</h2>
<p>PRC2 core complex is composed of <strong>Enhancer of zeste</strong> E(z), <strong>Suppressor of zeste 12</strong> Su(z)12, <strong>Extra sex combs</strong> (Esc) and <strong>p55</strong> (Nurf55 or Caf1).</p>
<p>E(z) methylate H3K27.</p>
<p>Esc bind H3K27me3 and facilitates multimerization of complex.</p>
<p>PRC1-mediated events are also thought to compact chromatin to limit the access of activating factors and the Psc subunit in particular has been linked to this function.</p>
<p>p55 is present in a number of chromatin remodeling complexes and interacts with Su(z)12, H3 and H4. The loss of loss of p55 appears to have little consequence on PRC2 activity.</p>
</div>
<div id="pho-complex" class="section level2">
<h2>Pho-complex</h2>
<p>The first complex, referred to as Pho repressive complex (PhoRC), is composed of Pho and Sfmbt. A second Pho-containing complex has also been described (Pho-INO80) that, in addition to Pho, contains the INO80 nucleosome remodeling complex (Klymenko, 2006). Pho binds DNA in a sequence-specific manner and help to recruit PcG complexes to their response elements (Grossniklaus and Paro, 2014).</p>
</div>
<div id="trxg-complex-components" class="section level2">
<h2>TrxG complex components</h2>
<p>TrxG include the COMPASS, COMPASS-like, TAC1 and ASH1 complexes, and SET domain HMTs.</p>
<p>Common subunits for COMPASS and COMPASS-like complexes include Ash2, Dpy30 (Dpy-30L1), Hcf1 (Hcf), Rbbp5 and Wds.</p>
</div>
<div id="pcgtrxg-response-elements" class="section level2">
<h2>PcG/TrxG response elements</h2>
<p>In Drosophila, the genomic nucleation sites of PcG- and TrxG-mediated epigenetic memory have been referred to as PcG/TrxG response elements (PRE/TREs).</p>
</div>
<div id="nuclear-architecture" class="section level2">
<h2>Nuclear architecture</h2>
<p>Nuclear architecture by PRC1 complex is disscussed in the recent review <span class="citation">(Illingworth 2019)</span></p>
</div>
<div id="open-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Open questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Although some PRE/TRE-like elements have been identified, it is unclear if all of the properties of the Drosophila PRE/TRE (e.g. epigenetic memory) are maintained in the mammalian system.</p></li>
<li><p>How PcG and TrxG proteins are recruited to these elements?<br />
We currently lack a clear understanding of the hierarchical recruitment of PcG and TrxG proteins to PRE/TREs, and elucidating these recruitment mechanisms is thus an area of active research.</p></li>
<li><p>What determines the active (TRE) versus repressed (PRE) state?</p></li>
<li><p>What factors d which PRC1 targets will physically interact?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the impact of stoichiometry of PRC1 subunits during development?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This page summarizes several recent reviews <span class="citation">(Geisler and Paro 2015)</span> to aggregate information in this actively studied area of research.</p>
